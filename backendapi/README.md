## Update : I have created API documentation using Swagger. You can access it by going to http://localhost:3000/api-docs. 


## API end points example : 
  #Event Module :

        "location" : "Anything",
        "date" : "2024-12-31T12:30:00+06:00", (make sure to use this format)
        "maxAttendees" : "Any positive number"
      }

    GET /event: List all events.
    GET /event/:id: Retrieve event details. 
    DELETE /event/:id: Delete an event.

  ## Description :
  
    # I have used ->
    - Prisma for database management.
    - Redis for caching.
    - BullJS for background jobs.
    - nodemailer for sending emails.
    - @nestjs/schedule to send reminders

    # I have ensured ->
    - maxAttendees is a positive integer.
    - Prevent overlapping events by validating the date.
    - Unique emails for attendees.
    - Total number of registrations doesnâ€™t exceed maxAttendees
    - Prevent attendees from registering for the same event multiple times.
    - Meaningful HTTP responses.
    - Cache invalidation for Create or deletions.
